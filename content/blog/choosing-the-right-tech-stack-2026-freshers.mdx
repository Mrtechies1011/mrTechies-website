## What Is a Tech Stack? (Simple Explanation)

A **tech stack** is the collection of technologies you use to build an application.

It usually includes:

- **Frontend** – what users see and interact with  
- **Backend** – business logic & APIs  
- **Database** – where data is stored  
- **Tools & Platforms** – hosting, version control, deployment  

👉 As a fresher, your goal is **clarity + employability**, not learning everything.

## Key Factors to Consider Before Choosing a Tech Stack

Before jumping into tools, ask yourself:

### 1️⃣ Job Market Demand (Most Important)
Learn what **companies are hiring for**, not what looks fancy on YouTube.

### 2️⃣ Learning Curve
Freshers should choose **simple, readable, well‑documented technologies**.

### 3️⃣ Community & Support
A strong community = faster learning + easier problem‑solving.

### 4️⃣ Long‑Term Growth
Your stack should scale from **beginner → professional**.

## Best Frontend Tech Stack for Freshers (2026)

### ✅ HTML, CSS & JavaScript (Non‑Negotiable)

These are **mandatory foundations**.

- HTML → structure  
- CSS → layout & responsiveness  
- JavaScript → logic & interaction  

💡 Do NOT skip fundamentals.

### ⭐ React.js (Top Choice in 2026)

**Why React is best for freshers:**

- Used by startups & enterprises
- Huge job demand
- Clean component‑based structure
- Works with modern frameworks like Next.js

**Learn this order:**
1. JavaScript basics  
2. React fundamentals  
3. Hooks & component patterns

### 🚀 Next.js (Strong Advantage)

Next.js is **React + performance + SEO**.

Freshers who know Next.js:

👉 **MrTechies Recommendation:**  
Learn **React first**, then **Next.js**.

Freshers should **use**, not depend on:
